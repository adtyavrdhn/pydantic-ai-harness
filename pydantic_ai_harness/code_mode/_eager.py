"""Eager execution for `CodeMode`: feed streamed `run_code` statements into the live REPL.

Eager execution runs the real program, in order, in the real session, as each top-level
statement closes in the stream. Nothing is predicted, so nothing can miss or be wasted --
and nothing can be rolled back: side effects land before the tool call is committed, which
is why the tier is opt-in.

A failed statement leaves the session exactly as a failed whole-snippet feed does today:
assignments made before the failing line persist and the error surfaces to the model as the
`run_code` result. The only semantic difference from non-eager execution is timing.
